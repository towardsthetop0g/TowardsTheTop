## 🔗 0G Tech Stack Integration 
Toward The Top leverages the **0G Labs stack**:
- **0G Storage** → Store in-game asset metadata & climbing stats on-chain  
- **0G Compute** → Physics calculations and leaderboard validation (offloaded to decentralized compute)  
- **0G Data Availability (DA)** → Guarantees reliable game data for multiplayer and state syncing  
- **0G Chain Integration** → Smart contracts for:
  - NFT asset minting & ownership  
  - Reward distribution  
  - Marketplace trades  

*Bonus:* Multi-component integration across storage, DA, and compute.
